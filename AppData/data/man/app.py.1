.SH MENTIONS
.sp
Application inspired and heavily based on the \fBupdateHostsFile.py\fP Python script found on \fI\%StevenBlack\(aqs repository\fP <\fBhttps://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts\fP>\&.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
.sp
No mayor requirements are needed to run this application other than Python 3.5+.
.SH DETAILED USAGE
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.IP "Highlights"
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
This application works with \fIprofiles\fP stored in \fBUserData/profiles\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
A profile is just a folder that contains a configuration file (\fBUserData/profiles/<profle_name>/conf.py\fP) and where all downloaded sources are stored and processed to generate a hosts file.
.IP \(bu 2
Each profile can have files named \fBwhitelist\fP and \fBblacklist\fP which contain a host name per line without inline comments.
.IP \(bu 2
Files named \fBglobal_blacklist\fP and \fBglobal_whitelist\fP inside \fBUserData\fP will be used by all profiles.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBwhitelist\fP file contains a list of host names that \fBwill NEVER be added\fP to the final hosts file.
.IP \(bu 2
A \fBblacklist\fP file contains a list of host names that \fBwill ALWAYS be added\fP to the final hosts file.
.IP \(bu 2
The \fBconf.py\fP file should contain at least a property named \fBsources\fP (mandatory \- a list of dictionaries) and another property named \fBsettings\fP (optional \- a dictionary).
.IP \(bu 2
This application can process text files formatted as a hosts file (\fB0.0.0.0 hostname.com\fP one rule per line), text files formatted as a list of host names (\fBhostname.com\fP one domain per line) and archives (7Zip files, Zip files and compressed and non\-compressed Tar files) containing any of the aforementioned text files.
.IP \(bu 2
If one wants to use data from sources in any other format, the data can be \fIpre\-processed\fP\&. See \fI\%pre_processors data key\fP\&.
